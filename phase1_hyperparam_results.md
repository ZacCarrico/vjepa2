## Key Findings

### 1. Learning Rate Impact (Most Important)

**Finding:** Learning rate has the strongest effect on model performance.

| Learning Rate | Val Acc | Test Acc | Improvement vs Baseline |
|---------------|---------|----------|------------------------|
| 5e-5          | 53.33%  | 53.33%   | -13.3% (worse)         |
| 1e-4          | 60.00%  | 63.33%   | -6.7%                  |
| **2e-4 (baseline)** | **66.67%** | **53.33%** | **0%** |
| **5e-4**      | **76.67%** | **63.33%** | **+10.0%** |
| **1e-3**      | **80.00%** | **63.33%** | **+13.3%** |

**Insight:** Increasing learning rate from 2e-4 to 1e-3 (5x) improves validation accuracy by 13.3 percentage points and test accuracy by 10 percentage points.

---

### 2. LoRA Rank Impact (Secondary)

**Finding:** Larger ranks improve validation accuracy but may overfit with limited data.

| Rank | Alpha | Val Acc | Test Acc | Trainable Params |
|------|-------|---------|----------|------------------|
| 8    | 16    | 70.00%  | 53.33%   | 249,860          |
| **16**   | **32**    | **66.67%** | **53.33%**  | **495,620**      |
| 32   | 64    | 70.00%  | 60.00%   | 987,140          |
| **64**   | **128**   | **83.33%** | **56.67%**  | **1,970,180**    |

**Insight:** Rank 64 achieves highest validation (83.33%) but shows val-test gap suggesting overfitting. Rank 32 provides good balance. Default rank 16 is parameter-efficient.

---

### 3. Alpha Ratio Impact (Minimal)

**Finding:** Alpha ratio has minimal impact when learning rate is fixed.

| Rank | Alpha | Ratio | Val Acc | Test Acc |
|------|-------|-------|---------|----------|
| 16   | 16    | 1     | 66.67%  | 53.33%   |
| 16   | 32    | 2     | 66.67%  | 53.33%   |
| 16   | 64    | 4     | 63.33%  | 56.67%   |

**Insight:** Default ratio of 2 (alpha = 2 × rank) is optimal. Other ratios don't improve performance.

---

### 4. Dropout Impact (None)

**Finding:** Reducing dropout from 0.10 to 0.05 provides no benefit.

| Dropout | Val Acc | Test Acc |
|---------|---------|----------|
| 0.05    | 66.67%  | 53.33%   |
| **0.10**    | **66.67%** | **53.33%**  |

**Insight:** Default dropout rate of 0.10 is appropriate for this task.
